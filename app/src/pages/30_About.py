Heading to a new city for your co-op? Or need someone to take your place while you chase those career dreams?  Whether you're heading to a new city for a co-op or need someone to take over your place while you’re gone, we’ve got you covered. Our app connects you to the right people, at the right time, in the easiest way possible.

With data-powered personalized recommendations, you’ll get sublet options that match your timeline, budget, and vibe. This app lets you create a listing in minutes and connects you directly with interested renters. Plus, with built-in reviews and messaging, you can make sure you’re making the right choice for both your place and your peace of mind.

Imagine this: You get to browse profiles of potential subletters, kind of like a dating app, but for apartments! You can see pictures, read fun bios, and get a feel for the vibe of the person who could be taking over your spot. No more guessing if they’ll respect your space—just swipe through profiles that match your timeline, vibe, and connect with ease.

Key features include:
“Match” with subletters and hosts based on compatibility (yes, it’s like swiping, but for housing!)
Profiles with bios and photos so you can get to know who you’re dealing with before making the leap.
Personalized recommendations for places that match your timeline and budget—no more endless scrolling.

With us, finding the perfect sublet or someone to take your place has never been more fun or effortless. So whether you’re looking for your next home away from home or renting out your place, we’re here to make the process stress-free and hassle-free!
