## Getting the WebPage Started 

Before starting the Docker containers, you need to configure your environment variables. Navigate to the .env file in the root directory of the project and ensure  the following configuration:
- SECRET_KEY: Used for securing sessions and cryptographic operations.
- DB_USER: MySQL username (typically root).
- DB_HOST: The database container's hostname (db).
- DB_PORT: The port for the MySQL database (default is 3306).
- DB_NAME: The name of the database (coopCribs)
- MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: The root password for the MySQL database.

Now, before interacting with the web app, ensure that Docker containers are running. This is necessary to start the Streamlit app, Flask API, and MySQL database.

To start the containers, run the following in the project directory:
'docker compose up'.

Once this has been perfomed go into docker desktop to make sure the containers web-app, web-api, and mysql_db are running.
Once the containers are running, you can access the web app at http://localhost:8501
